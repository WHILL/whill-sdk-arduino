A simple [WHILL Model CR](https://whill.jp/model-cr) Library for Arduino.<br>
We also have [a FAQ and developers community website](https://whill.zendesk.com/hc/ja) for current and potential Model CR users.<br>

## Requirements
- WHILL **Model CR**  (Normal **Model C** does not support serial communication.)
- An Arduino device suports SoftwareSerial. e.g. Arduino Uno.
- RS232C Shield  (Recommended:https://www.seeedstudio.com/RS232-Shield-p-1910.html)



## Getting Started
Download this repository and place on your Arduino library folder.

## APIs

### Communication

```cpp
WHILL(SoftwareSerial*)
```
Initialize WHILL instance with SoftwareSerial.

```cpp
WHILL::begin(unsigned int interval_ms)
```
Command WHILL to start reporting WHILL status.

```cpp
WHILL::refresh()
```
Fetch serial interface and do internal process.
Call this function , `WHILL::delay()` and/or `WHILL::keep_joy_delay()` once at least in `loop()`. Callbacks are fired when these functions are called.

```cpp
stopSendingData()
```
Command WHILL to stop report WHILL status.


### Manipulation

```cpp
WHILL::setJoystick(int x,int y)
```
Manipulate a WHILL via this command.


```cpp
WHILL::setPower(bool)
```
Turn on/off a WHILL. `True` to power WHILL on. 

```cpp
WHILL::setBatteryVoltaegeOut(bool)
```
Enable/Disable power supply to the interface connector. `True` to enable power supply.


### Sensors and Status

### Accelerometer [Not Supported]
```cpp
int WHILL::accelerometer.x
int WHILL::accelerometer.y
int WHILL::accelerometer.z
```
Accelerometer mounted on body.
Note: The IMU inside Model CR is not recommended to be used due to its low accuracy. Data is sent but not parsed.

#### Gyro [Not Supported]
```cpp
int WHILL::gyro.x
int WHILL::gyro.y
int WHILL::gyro.z
```
Gyro sensor mounted on body.
Note: The IMU inside Model CR is not recommended to be used due to its low accuracy. Data is sent but not parsed.

#### Battery
```cpp
unsigned char  WHILL::battery.level
signed   long  WHILL::battery.current
```
Remaining battery level and consumpting current[mA].


#### Motor State
```cpp
float   WHILL::left_motor.angle
int     WHILL::left_motor.speed

float   WHILL::right_motor.angle
int     WHILL::right_motor.speed
```
Motors angle and speed. The angle range is -PI to +PI, Speed unit is km/h.  
**Note that the speed value is low-pass filterd.**

#### Speed Mode
```cpp
bool   WHILL::speed_mode_indicator
```
Current selected speed mode.

### Callback

By registering callback functions, You can hook at status is updated.
